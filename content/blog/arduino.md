# Building the Arduino Cube

Launchpads, if you probably used them in a microcontrollers course, or computer architecture course. And you probably either liked it or hated it with burning passion. Some of those launchpads are the Texas Instruments [] or the [] which is a pretty [] board considering all the bells and whistles it has. However, I never have seen an arduino launchpad. Sure, there is a lot of shields that you can use for an Arduino UNO, I have two at home. But note that I said, _launchpad_, not _shield_. Here's a definition by ChatGPT:

A launchpad refers to a development platform or a hardware kit designed to help engineers, hobbyists, or students prototype and develop electronic projects. These launchpads often include a microcontroller or microprocessor, various sensors, input/output interfaces, and development tools.

Shields are not standalone boards, launchpads are. And this article is an attempt to create an arduino version of it. I started this project in December 16, 2023, after my finals. This article however started way back in November 29, 2023, near my finals. Why? Idk, had to procrastinate. So, this is where it all starts...


## The Idea

Last year I made my very own macroboard using the ATMEGA32U8, the same microchip used on the arduino Leonardo. I learned a lot of PCB design with that project and wanted to improve on what I learned, starting for cost! It cost around $100 USD to get two fully assembled boards, however that doesn't count the cost of the 3D printing of the case, nor the keycaps, nor the key switches which would make the price around $140 USD, give or take. 

For this project my goal is to make something much more affordable, I'm a broke college student after all. Here are a few key aspects of the project I figured out at the time:

* We're using the ATMEGA[], which is the microchip the UNO uses.
* Parts will be THT (Throughhole technology) to solder the parts at home.
* It will have the shape of a cube
* The launchpad will have all the sensors I have in a box (not really)
* Powered by batteries
* Has a type C connector

These aspects are somewhat vague, you may question yourself, what kind of sensors will this launchpad have? What are its applications? What are the dimensions of the board? How is the enclosure designed?

At the time of reading this, to be honest, I didn't had the answer. It's one of those things you do on impulse, something that, when waking up you go: "Hey what if I build this?", and promptly forget. In my case well, I just run with it to the very end.

Since this project is a work in progress I'll add Dates and progress reports to get a better feel on the things done in the board, what to do, what not to do, and things that you, the reader will make you screen at the screen on the very idiotic decisions I may do along the way, run with it, crash and finally backtrack.

### Hiatus

Finals Are soon to start, gotta work on a final project from Digital Electronics, research, TA duties, and competition. These following weeks are going to be hell on earth for me. Will continue after this
