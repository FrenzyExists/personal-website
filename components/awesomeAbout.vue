          <p class="text-lg mx-2 my-3 text-justify">My name is Angel, but you can call me Pikachu. I'm a Computer
            Engineering student at the University
            of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez. I've always been fascinated by the way computers and circuits
            work and how they can be used to solve complex problems. I am currently working on a research
            project with a professor in the Electrical
            Engineering department where we are developing a GUI for an existing testing CLI developed
            by Texas Instruments engineers.
